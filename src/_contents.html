      <h2>The FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) section</h2>
      <p><strong>How is Cardeal different from other online car buyers?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cardeal will buy "any" car even if it has a blown engine. At Cardeal we want to offer the highest value, quick
        payment for cars, convenience, and a secure transaction. If you sell us your car, you are not obligated to buy
        your next car from us although we promise that if you do you will get a great deal.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How is the price of my car calculated?</strong></p>
      <p>Prices are calculated based on the current market value of your car and its condition.</p>
      <p><strong>What costs will I be responsible for?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cardeal is a free service. There are no charges for evaluations and offers. If you sell a car with Cardeal, we
        pay for pick up and towing. We have no hidden costs.
      </p>
      <p><strong>How quickly can you have my vehicle picked up?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Cardeal has a branch in every state. Therefore, we can usually pick up your vehicle within 24 to 48 hours after
        you accept our offer.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What type of documentation will I need to provide?</strong></p>
      <p>
        When filling out the online form, you will be asked to enter your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). A
        vehicle's VIN contains its year, make, model, trim information and other auto options and details. Cardeal also
        requires a title in the seller's name. We cannot buy your vehicle without a valid, signed title from the
        registered vehicle owner.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Will you buy my car if I can't get it started?</strong></p>
      <p>
        If you have a damaged, wrecked or non-running car on your hands, Cardeal can help you get rid of it. We'll give
        you a fair market offer for your car that's tailored to your vehicle's conditions and local market demands.
