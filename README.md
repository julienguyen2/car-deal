# CarDeal Website
This project is a one-page website designed for Cardeal, a fictional company offering cash for cars. Utilizing Bootstrap 5 and SASS, the site features a customized, trendy design that avoids a generic Bootstrap look. The page includes a header with a logo and navigation menu, a hero section with a full-width image and form, and sections detailing the selling process, advantages, and testimonials. The design incorporates creative presentations for lists, a carousel for testimonials, and a section highlighting the main selling point with a call-to-action button. Additional features include a responsive display of recent purchases in Bootstrap cards and an accordion for FAQs. This project emphasizes a user-friendly and visually appealing design tailored to the clientâ€™s specifications.
